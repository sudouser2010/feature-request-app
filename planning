DEVELOPERS NOTES:

---------------------------------------------------------------------Round 1
purpose: allows user to create feature requests

each request must have the following:
    >>will call model FeatureRequest

    Title: A short, descriptive name of the feature request.
        >>char, 32

    Description: A long description of the feature request.
        >>char, 128

    Client: A selection list of clients (use "Client A", "Client B", "Client C")
        >>a simple dropdown produced by an enumeration of choices

    Client Priority: A numbered priority according to the client (1...n). Client Priority numbers should not repeat for the given client, so if a priority is set on a new feature as "1", then all other feature requests for that client should be reordered.
        >>this is the most interesting one. When a submission occurs, this data affects the position of all the other ones.
        >>I should use a unqiue_together meta attribute to ensure the priority and client are truly unique
        >>option1:
            -when a submission occurs, some code looks at the requests for a particular client. then it loops through and changes the
            priority.

        >>option2:
            -similar to option1 but uses the db to do a lot of the work
                say x is the new priority and c is the client
                -a: get priorties less than or equal to x and update them
                    FeatureRequest.objects.filter(client=c, priority__lte=x).update(priority=F('priority')+1)

                -b: create new FeatureRequest with priority of x and client of c

    Target Date: The date that the client is hoping to have the feature.
        >>I'll use the frontend date picker
        >>I'll use the datetime field

    Ticket URL: A field for storing any URL
        >>use the url field

    Product Area: A selection list of product areas (use 'Policies', 'Billing', 'Claims', 'Reports')
        >>use an enumeration of choices


Layout of app:
    left side:
        -submission form

    right side:
        -view requests for clients A, B, C


------------------------------------------------------------------Round 2


forms:
    -use a model form and set the attributes in model form definition
    -while defining the model form, I can set the Knockout bindings
