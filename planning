DEVELOPERS NOTES:






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Round 3
Assumptions:
    1 = highest priority
    n = lowest priority. This is the number of clients of a certain type.

    There are only A, B, and C clients



------------------------------------------------------------------Round 2
Approach to rendering form:
    option1: [favors Django's paradigm]
        -use django to render form in template
        -the max priority is dependent on the client. So whenever the client changes,
        an ajax call will occur to get the max priority.
        -with this approach, the bindings are handled by jquery and form generation by Django

    option2: [favors Knockout's paradigm]
        -do ajax call at beginning to get all client data. Use data to build form with KO loop
        -the data of all clients can be loaded initially
        -when the client is changed, there's no need for an ajax call
        -with this approach, the bindings and form generation are handled by KO
        -maybe use open source library such as djano-knockout-modeler

    options3: [combining KO and Django paradigm]
        -django renders form in template
        -use a model form and set the KO bindings as attributes in model form definition
        -when client is changed, an ajax call happens to get the new max priority
        -with this approach, the bindings are handled by KO and form generation by Django

    options4: [combining KO and Django paradigm, 1 ajax call]
        -django renders form in template
        -use a model form and set the KO bindings as attributes in model form definition
        -when client is changed, the max client is obtained from view model
        -one request is done at the beginning to load initial data
        -with this approach, the bindings are handled by KO and form generation by Django

    *the best way is with option4 b/c only one ajax call is done which gets all the client data
    all at once.

    *I'll use option4 b/c it offers the most flexibility and also gets all the client data at once

---------------------------------------------------------------------Round 1
purpose: allows user to create feature requests

each request must have the following:
    >>will call model FeatureRequest

    Title: A short, descriptive name of the feature request.
        >>char, 32

    Description: A long description of the feature request.
        >>char, 128

    Client: A selection list of clients (use "Client A", "Client B", "Client C")
        >>a simple dropdown produced by an enumeration of choices

    Client Priority: A numbered priority according to the client (1...n). Client Priority numbers should not repeat for the given client, so if a priority is set on a new feature as "1", then all other feature requests for that client should be reordered.
        >>this is the most interesting one. When a submission occurs, this data affects the position of all the other ones.
        >>I should use a unqiue_together meta attribute to ensure the priority and client are truly unique
        >>option1:
            -when a submission occurs, some code looks at the requests for a particular client. then it loops through and changes the
            priority.

        >>option2:
            -similar to option1 but uses the db to do a lot of the work
                say x is the new priority and c is the client
                -a: get priorties greater than or equal to x and update them
                    FeatureRequest.objects.filter(client=c, priority__gte=x).update(priority=F('priority')+1)

                -b: create new FeatureRequest with priority of x and client of c

    Target Date: The date that the client is hoping to have the feature.
        >>I'll use the frontend date picker
        >>I'll use the datetime field

    Ticket URL: A field for storing any URL
        >>use the url field

    Product Area: A selection list of product areas (use 'Policies', 'Billing', 'Claims', 'Reports')
        >>use an enumeration of choices


Layout of app:
    left side:
        -submission form

    right side:
        -view requests for clients A, B, C
